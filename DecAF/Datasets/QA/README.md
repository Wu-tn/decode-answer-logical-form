## Dataset Preprocessing

Please download folders [components](https://github.com/salesforce/rng-kbqa/tree/main/framework/components), [executor](https://github.com/salesforce/rng-kbqa/tree/main/framework/executor), and [ontology](https://github.com/salesforce/rng-kbqa/tree/main/framework/ontology) from [RnG-KBQA repository](https://github.com/salesforce/rng-kbqa) and put them under folder `SP_tools`.
The directory structure should be like this:
```
Datasets/QA/SP_tools

```

Please see each dataset folder for instructions on how to preprocess the data.
